- Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee, Texas
- Successfully isolated the seven most affected states for concentrated analysis

### ✅ **Phase 3: Precision Temporal Analysis**
**Captured complete hurricane lifecycle**
- Implemented accurate date filtering (August 17 - September 3, 2017)
- Isolated Harvey-specific events from background weather patterns
- Ensured comprehensive temporal coverage

### ✅ **Phase 4: Macro-Economic Impact Assessment**
**Quantified state-level property damage distribution**
- Calculated total financial impact across political boundaries
- Identified Texas as the economic epicenter of damages
- Established clear damage gradient patterns

### ✅ **Phase 5: Hyper-Local Damage Mapping**
**County-level vulnerability assessment completed**
- Drilled down to community-scale impact analysis
- Identified specific high-vulnerability counties within each state
- Enabled precision targeting insights for recovery efforts

### ✅ **Phase 6: Event Frequency Analytics**
**Storm intensity and density mapping**
- Quantified event frequency by geographical region
- Correlated repeated impact with damage severity
- Established patterns of compound disaster effects

### ✅ **Phase 7: Phenomenological Classification**
**Dominant damage mechanism identification**
- Classified primary event types (flooding, tornadoes, high winds)
- Analyzed multi-hazard interactions and amplification effects
- Provided insights for future building code recommendations
